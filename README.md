## **Project Status**
This project is currently in the planning phase. Contributions and suggestions are welcome as we finalize the architecture and feature set.

## **Planned Features**

### **PDF Management**
- Merge multiple PDF files into one.
- Split PDF files into smaller sections.
- Compress PDFs for reduced file size.
- Rotate pages within PDFs.

### **Conversion Tools**
- Word to PDF.
- PPT to PDF.
- JPG to PDF.

### **PDF Organization**
- Sort pages within PDFs.
- Add new pages to PDFs.
- Delete unwanted pages from PDFs.

### **Security Features**
- Add password protection to secure your PDFs.

### **Future Features**
- **OCR Support**: Extract text from scanned PDFs, written entirely in Rust.
- **Advanced Conversion**: Support for additional formats and customization options.

## **Why This Project?**
PDF management tools are often either bloated with unnecessary features or locked behind a paywall. This project aims to deliver a lightweight, open-source, and efficient PDF management tool for Linux and Windows users.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Language**: Rust
- **Framework**: GTK for building the GUI
- **Cross-Platform Support**:
  - Default version on Windows.
  - GTK-based version on Linux.

## **How to Get Involved**
We welcome contributions! Here are some ways to get involved:
1. **Feature Suggestions**: Have ideas for features? Open an issue to discuss them.
2. **Code Contributions**: Fork the repository and send a pull request.
3. **Testing**: Help test the application as features are implemented.

### **Planned Development Milestones**
1. Basic PDF merging and splitting tools.
2. Conversion features (Word/PPT/JPG to PDF).
3. Security and organization tools.
4. OCR integration and advanced features.
